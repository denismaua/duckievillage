# Duckievillage

![Duckievillage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RenatoGeh/duckievillage/master/duckieusp.png)

Duckievillage is an adaptation of [Duckietown](https://duckietown.org)'s OpenAI Gym
[gym-duckietown](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) for the undergraduate level [Intro
to Robotics](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0318&nomdis=) (MAC0318)
course held at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br/) (IME) of the
[University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english) (USP).

This project is not to be thought of as a fork or standalone project, but as a complement to
Duckietown's Gym. To be more precise, Duckievillage's objectives are two-fold: to be an environment
wrapper around `DuckietownEnv`, which allows a more custom-made environment for our own robotics
course; and to be used as course walkthrough.

## Installation

We will assume you have provided your credentials to github (`ssh-keygen`, etc).

Clone this repository into your home folder:
```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:denismaua/duckievillage.git
```

It is **highly recommended** that you use a python environment, for example:

```bash
cd
virtualenv duckievillage
```

To activate this environment, do

```bash
source ~/duckievillage/bin/activate
```

**You will need to activate this environment every time you use this package**. 

Clone (the patched version of) `gym-duckietown` inside `duckievillage`'s folder:

```bash
cd ~/duckievillage
git clone https://github.com/denismaua/gym-duckietown.git duckietown

``` 

Install Duckieotwns's dependencies (this might take a while):

```bash
cd duckietown && pip3 install -e .
```

Fork the `duckievillage-assignments` repository on github:

> https://github.com/denismaua/duckievillage-assignments


Now clone the assignments (notice that you have substitute `<YOUR_USERNAME>` below in the addres with your github username):

```bash
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/duckievillage-assignments.git assignments
```

---

## Testing

Cd to the folder where this file is located and activate you environment (if not already acrivated):

```bash
cd ~/duckievillage
source bin/activate
```

Test your setup with:

```bash
python3 assignments/manual/manual.py
```

This should open the simulator graphical interface and run the code for the first assignment.
If you haven't changed the file `assignments/manuam/manual.py` the roboy should not move. 
See [assignments/manual/README.md] for instructions on how to modify the file `manual.py` to make your own manually controlled simulated duckiebot!

If you get an error, trying restarting your computer. If the error persists see the [FAQ](#troubleshooting) section below.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall, simply remove the folder `duckievillage`:

```bash
cd
rm -Rf duckievillage
```

---

## Troubleshooting

1. I get an error when trying to `git clone` the `duckievillage` or `duckietown` repo: the directory already exists. This probably due to a previously installed/cloned version. To remove it, do:

> `cd`
> `rm -Rf duckievillage`

Then follow the instructions for [installation](#Installation).

2. Something goes wrong involving gym-duckietown.

> You might have a different version of gym-duckietown installed or Python is simply not finding the proper path.
> Try adding this installation to the PATH:
> `echo "export PYTHONPATH=\"\${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/duckievillage/duckietown/src\"" >> ~/.bashrc`
> Resource your rcfile with `source ~/.bashrc` and reactivate the environment `source ~/duckievillage/bin/activate`

2. I get a permission denied when trying to clone from within a WSL shell!

> You should clone from a WSL partition, and not from your Windows NTFS. Do `cd ~` and retry.

4. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'duckievillage'`

> You have to `cd` to the Duckievillage root directory (i.e. the directory you cloned). If the
> error persists, try either closing your shell session and opening another one (don't forget to
> `cd` to the Duckievillage root directory and activate your environment), or sourcing
> your rcfile.

5. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'zuper_commons'`

> You have to activate the Duckietown environment.


6. `pyglet.gl.ContextException: Could not create GL context`

> This might either be a VM issue or a Pyglet version issue. VMs are not supported in
> Duckievillage. If it's Pyglet, you may want to either try updating the Anaconda environment with
> the latest python and packages; or alternatively ditch Anaconda and install everything with
> `pip`. For the latter, you might want to completely remove Anaconda so Python doesn't get
> confused with package versions (or at least completely isolate Anaconda from another Python
> environment. See the [pip alternative](#alternative-pip-installation) instructions. Wayland might
> also cause this problem. Consider using a Xorg backend for your Desktop Environment or Window
> Manager instead.
